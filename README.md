# About Me

I am a PhD researcher interested in the interface of **quantum physics** and **machine learning**. 

My current and recent work focuses on simulating the **nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated quantum matter** in **two- and three-dimensional systems**. This includes the use of **neural quantum states** for large-scale simulations of quantum many-body dynamics, as well as **exact time-evolution and Krylov-subspace methods** to study **constrained quantum matter** with restricted Hilbert spaces.

## Interests
- Quantum many-body dynamics  
- Machine learning for quantum physics
- Quantum Information and Matter
- Constrained quantum matter
