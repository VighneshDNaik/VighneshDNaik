# About Me

I am a PhD researcher working at the interface of **artificial intelligence and quantum physics**. My current and recent work focuses on simulating the **nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated quantum matter** in **two- and three-dimensional systems**.

This includes the use of **neural quantum states** for large-scale simulations of quantum many-body systems, as well as employing **exact time evolution and Krylov-subspace methods** to study **constrained quantum models** with restricted Hilbert spaces.

## Interests
- Quantum many-body dynamics
- Machine learning for quantum physics
- Constrained quantum matter
- High-performance scientific computing
